## First part: Getting the data
In Given API data we had to use is attached as a file. So for getting the data I used a NodeJS server with curl. When server recieves a GET request to its base adress it sends a get request to API, parses it  and sends data to requester.

## Second part: UI
It was quite easy. I used the javascript and HTML for it.
