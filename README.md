## First part: Getting the data
In Given API, data we had to use is an attached file. So for getting the data I used a NodeJS server with curl. When server recieves a GET request to its base adress it sends a get request to API, parses it  and sends data to requester.

## Second part: UI
It was quite easy. I used the javascript and HTML for it.

## How to use ?
-Download the project
-Open terminal in project directory
-Run `npm i` command on terminal
-Run `npm run start` command on terminal
-Open **Index.html** file on **frontend** directory
